After a long time, I got to watch two movies on a flight from Tokyo to Singapore.

- The story of a man who knew infinity.
- Ka and Ki

I was inspired a lot by the first movie. I knew about Ramanujam from the book I read as a child. But I didn't feel any connection with the character. It is probably this movie's narration or actors skills that captured my attention. Impressions that I formed after watching the movie were

- I could closely relate with the character of Prof Hardy. I consider myself an atheist who wouldn't believe in anything without a proof. Ramanujam tells Mr Hardy that he comes up with these formulae with pure intuition from his discussions with his deity Namagiri. I cannot believe with this notion, but like Mr Hardy I do respect Mr Ramanujam and am intrigued by his genius. I strongly believe that Ramanujam was unable to express his intuition and lies about it to avoid the discussion.
- It seems that Ramanujam was suffering from malnutrition. I still believe that it is stupidity to stick with your principles when you are on a foreign land. I believe that it is important for people to embrace new customs from different cultures especially when they are in a different country. This topic is still relevant in today's world.

The next movie is a Hindi movie. It is about to bring out the importance of homemakers. In India it is natural that homemakers are given less credit than they deserve. I have seen this in my own family. I congratulate the makers to take this concept, but I think they have messed up the plot in several ways.

- Choosing a male as a homemaker. This is a new topic and battle on its own. Mixing this topic with the main topic has loosened the plot a lot.
- Zealous about career growth of life partner. This is also a different topic.

I think the storyline has deviated from the conclusion what the writer wanted to convey. I think the story could have been much better.
