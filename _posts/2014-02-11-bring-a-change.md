Away from college, into a company for about 1 and half an year, I should say I gained a rich experience.
The major take away is team development.  

I now understand, how difficult is it to bring in a new change into a team. Be it a new policy or new technology.
I have helped few of my colleagues in bringing tremendous changes and planning to do it myself in the near feature. I would like to jot down the steps involved (This is strictly my view. There are pros out there who have better solution):

* Are you not satisfied with a technology or a policy? If yes, Hola! You have a new possible change!
* Do your analysis and list down all the demerits and how is it effecting the team.
* Its time to discuss this with your manager/leader. Is your manager a d**k, never mind, choose a person who you are comfortable and is in a position to influence.
* If you are not still convinced after the discussion, please look for a better alternative. This search often leads to a state, why the team is stuck with such an option. If you managed to get a better solution, please validate it. Compare the existing choice and your solution.
- Discuss with the “comfortable” person about your findings. Either you realize its a bad solution or he gets convinced that its a good solution. If you realize its a bad solution, please proceed to the previous step.
- If you have reached this step, Congrats. Discuss this with your peers. Collect their opinion.
- The final task – who will bring in this change?? Its you. Most teams have got targets to meet. They don’t have time deal with some xyz change you want to bring. Take the step forward, chalk our the plan, make targets and do it in your spare time. I feel this step needs courage and confidence.
- Finally, congrats if you are successful. Bingo, if you are not. You are in a win-win situation.

Please comment on my crazy train of thoughts, which I blogged.
