Most people want to evaluate the standard of living when they make the choice of shifting cities for work.
This is quiet common. To help people out I want to list down general expenses for the city I live in currently – Singapore.  

Singapore is certainly a great place to visit. It’s a great place to settle down as well because it is safe and secure. But if you are bachelor like me, its kind of boring as it’s a very small place. It takes you less than half a year to completely explore and exhaust the place.

Let’s take my case. I am an Indian and I consider myself an average spender. My monthly expenses are:

* 1 Common Room HDB – 800 SGD
* Food – 20 SGD * 30 – 600 SGD
* Entertainment – 40/week * 4 = 160 SGD
* Miscellaneous – 400 SGD

This is about 2000 SGD/ month. It varies a lot though.
