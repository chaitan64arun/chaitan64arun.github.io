In University, most of us work on a project alone. It is easy to develop, test and maintain our code. Once we step into an industry, we need to collaborate in teams to bring out a product.

In this article, I would list down some important concepts that help a team in software development. In the future articles, I would like to explain how there are used in a team.

* Revision Control (eg. SVN, GIT)
* Issue Tracking System (eg. BugZilla, Trac)
* Continuous Integration (Jenkins)
* Build System (ANT, Maven)
* Shared Database.

I was very new to all these software which help in making software. I hope this article gives a heads up to a team collaborated environment.
